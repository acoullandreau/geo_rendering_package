Purpose of this package
-----------------------

This package is designed to render maps from a **shapefile**.
It allows you to:
	- create an image file of any size with the shapefile map rendered on it
	- convert the projection system to scale the shapefile map on the image_size
	- draw points and fill shapes on the map
	- add text on the map


Requirements
------------

The code is written in Python 3.7.

There are several dependencies for this package. The versions provided here are those used for testing.
- numpy 1.16.4

- pandas 0.25.0
- pyshp 2.1.0
- unittest (python standard library)
- mock 3.0.5 (or unittest.mock)

Further work and improvements
-----------------------------

Some improvements that could be performed on the package:

- convert id should not go beyond 0
- handle errors if points in calculate_boundaries are not lists of tuples
- handle errors if points in calculate_centroid are not lists of tuples
- handle errors if points to render on map is not a list of coordinates (type POLYGON)
- format of input for interpolate_next_position
- in general, handle better errors related to the format of an input
